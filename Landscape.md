# eWaterCycle Landscape Overview

*The eWatercycle II project aims to overcome the challenge of locality in hydrological models using a Community Multi-Model environment. In eWatercycle II we will build an e-Infrastructure that will allow quick and safe inclusion of sub-models and model concepts into global hydrological models, leading to better understanding of the global hydrological cycle.
In this document we review the landscape of state-of-the-art hydrological research. 
We examine overall related projects and platforms that we are inspired by and that we would potentially collaborate with, as well as software, models and databases that we would like to use, or reference in our project (or at least be aware of).*

## Overall related projects

**[CSDMS](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page):** The Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System is a group of experts dealing with research about the Earth’s surface. The group support the development, sharing of models to explain Earth’s surface processes by disseminating integrated software. They mainly deals with movements of fluids and the flux of sediments and their basins.

**[CUASHI HIS](http://his.cuahsi.org):**  The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrological Science developed a suite of applications to enable hydrological researchers to share their data. The suite is made of three components: the HydroServer, the HydroCatalog and the HydroDesktop. The HydroServer provides access to the data, the HydroCatalog provides search functions for data discovery and the HyroDesktop app allows modeling and analysis of the data locally.

**[Hydroshare](https://www.hydroshare.org):** Community platform to share data, models and code. Operated by CUASHI HIS. Can be used to share, access, visualize and manipulate a broad set of hydrologic data types and models. Roughly consists of file storage to share resources (data/publications/code/executables/ etc), and added functionalities like metadata descriptions, data access API, DOI data publication and an apps library (e.g., jupyterhub notebook, online SWAT, HydroshareGIS and others). 

**[The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf.llnl.gov/):** Peer-to-Peer (P2P) enterprise system is a interagency and international collaboration that provides software infrastructure for the management, dissemination, and analysis of model output and observational data. ESGF's primary goal is to facilitate advancements in Earth System Science. Users can apply for access to the data, i.e., they are provided a username and password.
Users can request a persistent identifier to be assigned to the dataset that they upload.
ESGF "core" metadata includes mandatory and optional fields that are needed to search and download data throughout the ESGF system. These fields are not specific to any scientific discipline, rather they are common to any discipline that intends to leverage the ESGF infrastructure. Core metadata fields are defined in the ESGF meta-schema file esgf.xml, which is always used for validation whenever metadata records are published.

**[Aqueduct Global Flood Analyzer](http://floods.wri.org/#/):** The Aqueduct Global Flood Analyzer is a web-based interactive platform which measures river flood impacts by urban damage, affected GDP, and affected population at the country, state, and river basin scale across the globe, as well as 120 cities.

**[OpenStreams](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/OpenS):** A collection of building blocks for integrated Hydrological models. Integrated modeling means to connect multiple models for different domains (e.g., surface water domein and groundwater domain) so the interaction processes between the domains will be taken into account. The aim is to allow integrated modelling, promote usage of model tools in different frameworks and settings,and  provide applications for model coupling.

**[ESMF](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/esmf/):** Consortium of US institutes (NASA, National Weather Center, etc.). Hosted by the university of Colorado. They deal with Earth Sciences, predominantly oceanography and atmospheric physics. Mostly focussed on HPC (native interfaces).
